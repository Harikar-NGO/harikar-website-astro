### Introduction:

On September 21, 2023, Harikar Outreach Team and Community Outreach
Volunteers (COVs), in collaboration with UNHCR, organized a vibrant
celebration of the International Day of Peace. The event took place in
the Gawilan refugee camp, as part of the Protection and Assistance
program for Refugees and IDPs in Duhok-Iraq Project. The primary aim
of this initiative was to commemorate and strengthen the ideals of
peace within and among the community and all peoples.

### Activities:

Regarding the activity plan, there was a march starting
from Sector (G) and ending at the Gawilan community center in Sector
(E). During the march, the participants wear white caps and hold and
raise white flags in their hands showing the visibility of
Peace. While reaching the end point there was a short session on Peace
and social cohesion importance, then the participants planted trees
inside the community center. In the end, all the participants, COVs,
and the Outreach Team cut the celebration cake and distributed a
package of gifts (books for reading, plastic water bottles, and white
T-shirts) among the participants.

### Objective(s)

1. Promoting peace and tolerance: The primary objective is to raise
   awareness and promote the idea of peace among individuals, and
   communities., especially for the recently transferred families from
   Bardarash camp to Gawilan camp.
2. Conflict prevention and resolution: Efforts can be made to prevent
   conflicts and resolve existing ones. It aims to emphasize the
   importance of dialogue, mediation, and diplomacy in resolving
   disputes, rather than resorting to violence or war.
3. Advocate for the rights of refugees: The International Day of Peace
   can also serve as a platform to raise awareness and advocate for
   the rights of refugees within the camp. It creates an opportunity
   to address the issues they face and work towards finding
   sustainable solutions, which are fundamental for ensuring lasting
   peace.

### Impacts:
