## Introduction

In a significant step towards addressing the pressing issue of
gender-based violence (GBV), the Harikar NGO-GBV unit, founded by UNHCR,
recently conducted a three-day training program. The training aimed to
equip participants from governmental and non-governmental agencies
(DMCR, BCF, and DOLSA) with a comprehensive understanding of GBV core
concepts and effective case management strategies. This article delves
into the key achievements of this training initiative and highlights its
importance in the fight against GBV.

## A Comprehensive Training Approach

The training program proved to be a resounding success, catering to 33
participants representing various governmental and non-governmental
agencies actively engaged in GBV-related work. The training was
thoughtfully designed to offer participants more than just theoretical
knowledge. Instead, it provided them with practical skills, techniques,
and strategies that could be immediately applied in both personal and
professional contexts.

## Key Achievements of the Training

1.  **Knowledge Dissemination:** One of the primary objectives of the
    training was to ensure participants gained an in-depth understanding
    of essential terms related to sexual and gender-based violence. By
    providing a common language, the training facilitated smoother
    communication and collaboration among agencies.

2.  **Unified Understanding:** The training played a pivotal role in
    harmonizing participants\' comprehension of gender-based violence.
    By delving into its various forms, underlying causes, contributing
    factors, and far-reaching consequences, the program fostered a
    shared perspective among participants, which is essential for
    coordinated efforts.

3.  **Preventive Strategies:** Preventing GBV is as vital as responding
    to it. The training equipped participants with a range of strategies
    to tackle this issue at its roots. These strategies ranged from
    community awareness initiatives to the implementation of policies
    that address the fundamental drivers of GBV.

4.  **Effective Case Management:** Dealing with survivors of S/GBV
    requires specialized skills and sensitivity. The training
    effectively covered case management techniques, ensuring
    participants were prepared to approach survivors with compassion,
    provide necessary support, and connect them with appropriate
    resources.

5.  **Immediate Applicability:** Perhaps one of the most commendable
    aspects of the training was its emphasis on immediate applicability.
    By imparting skills that could be utilized both personally and
    professionally, the training empowered participants to take
    meaningful action against GBV right away.

## Conclusion

The successful training conducted by the Harikar NGO-GBV unit,
represents a significant stride forward in the fight against
gender-based violence. Through its comprehensive approach, the training
not only imparted knowledge but also fostered a deeper understanding of
GBV and its various dimensions.
