On August 10th and 13th, 2023, Harikar Outreach team, in collaboration
with UNHCR, organized a vibrant celebration of International Youth
Day. The event took place in the Bardarash and Gawilan refugee camps,
as part of the Protection and Assistance program for Refugees and IDPs
in Duhok-Iraq. The primary aim of this initiative was to empower young
refugees by providing them with a platform for self-expression,
promoting their psychological well-being, and preserving their unique
cultural identity.

The event commenced with an enlightening awareness session,
emphasizing the crucial role of youth in the community. Following
this, a drawing competition took place, featuring ten talented youth
painters from each community center. Equipped with canvases, the
participants unleashed their creativity and expressed their emotions,
experiences, and dreams through art. To select the winners, the
community members themselves cast their votes, ensuring a fair and
inclusive process. The chosen artists were awarded prizes, and the
festivities concluded with the cutting of a celebratory cake, shared
by all participants, community outreach volunteers (COVs), and the
outreach team.

The main objectives of the activity were:

1. Self-expression and communication: The drawing activities provided
   a platform for young refugees to express their thoughts and
   emotions creatively. Through art, they were able to share their
   experiences, dreams, and aspirations with the wider community.

2. Psychological well-being: Engaging in drawing activities can have
   therapeutic effects, particularly for young individuals living in
   challenging circumstances. By providing an outlet for their
   emotions, the event aimed to reduce stress and enhance their
   overall well-being.

3. Cultural preservation and expression: The drawing activities
   showcased and promoted the unique cultural identity of young
   refugees. By celebrating their heritage and traditions, the event
   aimed to foster a sense of pride and preserve their cultural
   heritage.

Reviving International Youth Day within a refugee camp carries
significant benefits. It raises global awareness about the rights and
challenges faced by young refugees worldwide. It serves as a platform
to acknowledge their resilience, achievements, and contributions to
society despite their circumstances. By providing young refugees with
an opportunity to voice their concerns, aspirations, and visions for
the future, the event empowers them and encourages their active
participation in decision-making processes within the camp.

The International Youth Day celebration organized by Harikar’s
Outreach team and UNHCR showcased the transformative power of art in
empowering young refugees. By embracing their creativity, the event
fostered self-expression, psychological well-being, and cultural
preservation.
