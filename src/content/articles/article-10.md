In commemoration of International Diabetes Day, Harikar NGO took a
proactive step toward community well-being by organizing a specialized
session facilitated by our dedicated Community Outreach Volunteers
with the help of a nurse from the community (Saadon Mohammed
Ahmed). The primary aim was to equip a selected portion of the
community with essential knowledge and tools for effectively managing
diabetes. This initiative aligns with our commitment to fostering
health awareness and empowerment within the communities we serve.

### Objectives

- Educational Empowerment: Provide comprehensive education on the use
  of glucose meter devices.
- Hands-On Learning: Facilitate a practical session for community
  members to learn the proper use of the device.
- Accessible Tools: Giving away glucose meter devices to enable
  individuals to monitoring their own health.

### Impact:

The session proved to be a pivotal moment in the lives of the
participants. Our dedicated Outreach Volunteers not only shared
crucial information on diabetes management but also provided tangible
tools to support ongoing health monitoring. By ensuring access to
glucose meters, we are enabling individuals to take
charge of their health, fostering a proactive approach to diabetes
management.

The impact extends beyond the immediate recipients of the devices. The
ripple effect within the community creates a culture of shared
knowledge, where individuals become advocates for healthier living. As
Harikar NGO continues to champion such initiatives, we envision a
community that is not only informed but actively engaged in
prioritizing and maintaining their well-being.

In conclusion, our International Diabetes Day activity exemplifies
Harikar NGO's commitment to empowering, educating, and supporting the
community. Through strategic initiatives like these, we strive
to create lasting positive changes in the lives of those we serve,
promoting a healthier and more resilient community.
