The Global Refugee Forum, held every four years in Geneva, is a vital
platform for galvanizing global action on the refugee crisis. In
December 2023, over 4,200 participants from 168 countries, including
government officials, refugees, and humanitarian organizations,
convened to translate the Global Compact on Refugees into concrete
commitments.  Co-convened by five States – Colombia, France, Japan,
Jordan, and Uganda – and co-hosted by the government Switzerland and
UNHCR.

Mr. Salah Y. Majid, Executive Director for Harikar NGO was invited by
Save the Children International (SCI) to attend the GRF 2023 as a
representative of the Alliance, Child Protection and Humanitarian
Action (CPHA), and presented a keynote highlighting the alliances
successes in reducing family violence, empowering youth, and
navigating complex protection needs, emphasizing the crucial role of
child participation and inclusivity amidst ongoing challenges.

In the keynote, the Executive Director of Harikar highlighted Harikar
and SCI’s significant achievements in child protection and
psychosocial support (PSS) activities amid the protracted crisis in
Iraq. Harikar NGO, a strategic partner of Save the Children
International, has focused on localization, child-led initiatives,
community-led protection, legislative work, and specialized mental
health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) programs.

The keynote emphasized the crucial role of girls' and boys'
participation in the success of interventions. By actively engaging
the community's youth, Harikar NGO empowers the younger generation and
enhances the overall impact and sustainability of initiatives. The
strategic approach involves child-centered design, where children are
involved in designing activities that address their needs and
concerns.

Highlighting the importance of inclusivity, Harikar’s Executive
Director, noted that they "adapt activities to be inclusive for
children with disabilities whenever possible." He drew attention to
the ongoing challenges faced by Iraqi children, particularly the 1.2
million IDPs, 300,000 refugees, 3.5 million out-of-school children,
and the 25% lacking civil documentation. Despite funding constraints,
Mr. Salah stressed the critical need to "continue responding to them
through the generous donors." as humanitarian actors in Iraq are
suffering from severe fund cuts.

The Executive Director of Harikar hopes that sharing these success
stories will inspire continued dedication to the humanitarian mission
in Iraq and looks forward to building on these achievements for an
even more significant impact in the future.
