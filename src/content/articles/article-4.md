Harikar in partnership with SCI and under SIDA has been delivering
protection assistance to the most vulnerable IDPs in the Chamishko camp
since 2021. The project aims to scale up outreach and services in
out-of-camp locations for IDPs, prioritize community-based protection
programming, and strengthen the capacity of authorities, communities,
and existing protection systems.

Harikar (in partnership with SCI) is proposing a community-based design
approach aiming at overcoming the barrier of engaging and protecting the
most difficult-to-reach/disabled/vulnerable girls, boys' men, and
women. This approach aims at shifting the mindset of humanitarian
workers to take a step back and give space and opportunities for
communities to take the lead in solving these problems.

The goal is to reach and engage girls and boys in programming that
catalyzes their potential and supports protection outcomes. The approach
allows the project to

1.  More intentionally identify, reach and engage vulnerable
    sub-populations of girls and boys and hard-to-reach families through
    meaningful engagement.

2.  More eï¬€ectively design protective, asset-building interventions that
    are responsive to the context-specific profile of girls and children
    with disabilities.

3.  Engage the broader community, particularly armed groups, and armed
    forces presumed/affiliated families, who often due to cultural
    factors "have a say" in their future to address the stigma around
    inclusion.

The project conducts a wide variety of activities, including; Livelihood
services that aim at promoting self-reliance and livelihood
opportunities for displacement-affected IDPs and vulnerable host
communities. It is designed to serve as a bridge between humanitarian
assistance and longer-term recovery and development strategies by
identifying entry points to assistance for households at different risk
levels: addressing basic needs and reducing reliance on negative coping
strategies for extremely vulnerable households through cash transfers,
creating job opportunities and income generation for at-risk households

So far, 60 families have received MPCA (Multi-purpose Cash Assistance),
38 have received Cash for protection and 71 have received Life Skills
Training. And more services (Vocational training, Business grants, and
Apprenticeship) are to be delivered to beneficiaries.

The other set of activities includes; structured play and recreational
activities. As well as awareness sessions for girls, boys, caregivers,
community members and parents on child protection issues.

The project has reached 643 beneficiaries through awareness campaigns
on messages aim at delivering messages to raise their knowledge in
general and empowering them to more effectively cope with their faced
challenges/needs. And it established gender-balanced adolescent/youth
clubs including girls and boys identified and targeted through the
case management social workers and the community-based networks
including the Child Protection committees. MHPSS and Protection
services that are supporting girls, boys, and caregivers to cope with
stress and anxiety through mobile and static child-centered designed
MHPSS interventions.

120 beneficiaries (Caregivers) Have been reached through PwV Program
(Parents without violence) which aims to help in building strong
relationships between children and their parents/caregivers to enable
them to resolve problems together, in addition to case management
services, which helps assess, planning, monitoring, and evaluating the
services and possible options required for the beneficiary's needs.

This project aims to target boys, girls, men, and women who are
considered hard to reach including child survivors of SGBV, children
associated with armed forces and armed groups (CAAFAG), and children
with disabilities from IDPs.

The project prioritizes the Centrality of Protection and our proposed
intervention considers context-specific vulnerabilities including gender
dynamics and a need for conflict-sensitive approaches throughout the
entire project lifecycle.

It also ensures that all children, including adolescents, have access to
quality, context-specific, and individualized reintegration support. It
also incorporates feedback and lessons learned on programme
interventions into larger organizational learning mechanisms.

The project is also working to hard equip local stakeholders, including
parents, teachers, community members, relevant authorities, and local
partners, with the practical experience and technical knowledge to
sustain protection services for children. By transferring knowledge,
tools, and skills, as well as improving linkages to government
structures, local communities, and authorities to promote and maintain
ownership and sustainability beyond the scope of this project.
