Childhood and adolescence are sensitive periods of life, being in
contact with the law and entering the justice system could be a
traumatic experience for them if they were not provided with
high-quality services. For that Harikar NGO in their project to
enhance justice for children services and system in KRI, which is
implemented in Partnership with UNICEF; is conducting multiple
activities for stakeholders and services providers who are in direct
contact with children. Despite the progress over recent years in Duhok
and Erbil with assistance from UNICEF and others, much work remains
undone with various stakeholders and institutions to ensure that the
juvenile justice system functions to uphold the rights and best
interests of children in contact with the law.

Referring to article number 37 of the child rights convention, child
detention must be the last option and for the shortest period
possible. For that Harikar with the support of UNICEF is seeking to
adopt alternatives to detentions and diversion systems assuring that
the children are not deprived of their liberty and that their rights
are not violated in the justice system.

The diversion system is a method used for reformation of the
children's misbehavior taking into consideration the social,
psychological, and environmental factors which contributed to child
delinquency. As the age of criminal responsibility in KRI is 11 years
old which is considered low compared to the international standards
(14 years old), children may not be fully aware of the consequences of
their actions. Thus building children's resilience, strengthening
their capacity, and engaging them in social and vocational activities
will contribute to building their personality. And all this is at risk
when a child is put into detention.

With the support of the international consultant, DR. Hatem Kotrane
(law professor in France), a round table discussion was conducted with
relevant stakeholders from the judiciary council, ministry of
justices, and lawyer syndicates to discuss the opportunities and
challenges in KRI for applying such systems.

Throughout the discussions, participants highlighted multiple
supportive articles of Juvenile welfare care act 76 Y 1983, which urge
the need of finding an alternative to detentions, yet the shortage is
in the implementation of the law. Challenges were highly related to
the lack of financial support for courts and reformatory centers, as
the government has no allocated budget for child protection. The law
number of specialized judges was also a challenge, as the same judge
who sees children case will also see adult cases which in total
reaches 200 cases per day. The small building of reformatory centers,
overcrowding, lack of special PSS programs, and poor reintegration
activities was also highlighted as shortages of providing qualitative
services to children in reformatory centers.

Dr. Hatem shared the recommendations of the United Nations regarding
the rights of children in contact with the law, as the United Nations
was concerned about the reports which indicate poor services provided
for children, the possibility of using violence during investigations,
the duration of detention for investigations, unavailability of the
medical report (physical and mental) from the very moment of entering
the justice system.

The following were the recommendations of the participants:

- The presence of a lawyer to represent the child should be mandatory for the time of initial investigations.
- Child caregivers must be engaged in the process if it's in the best interest of the child.
- The police officers, investigators, and judges must be dedicated only to children's cases and be separated from adult cases.
- The duration of detention for investigation must be set and should not be more than 24-48 hours.
- The judge has more authority for finding alternative ways to detention assuring that detention is the last option and for the shortest duration possible.
- Adopting a diversion system with a legal framework.
- Assuring availability of medical records with the starting of initial investigations in the police stations.
