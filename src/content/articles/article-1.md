Within the general framework agreement of Harikar and UNICEF "enhance
justice for children services and system in Duhok and Erbil governorates
KR-Iraq" multiple workshops are planned to strengthen the capacity of
services providers for providing qualitative services for children in
contact with law.

Police officers play a vital role in the justice system, as they are the
very first people who contact children when interring the justice system
either as witness or when committing a delinquency. Thus it's very
important for them to be trained on standard procedures of how to
approach children during investigations. In coordination with ministry
of interior; a three days capacity building training was organized for
20 police officers affiliated to directorate of police - Duhok.

On August 30th 2022, with the presence of Mr. Salah Yasin the
Executive director of Harikar NGO; the training started by a speech
delivered by Brigadier General Fakhri Ahmed (the head of Duhok police
officer department), who urged the need of such trainings which serve
for the benefit of children in contact with law, and he also thanked
Harikar and UNICEF for their usual support for children.

One of the main objectives of the training was enhance capacity of
police officers for communicating with children, trust building, and
assuring that the children will have a less traumatic experience while
interring the justice system. Taking into consideration the sensitivity
of their age with the all other psychological changes during adolescent
age, the investigation experience might be very traumatic for the child,
especially when passing by multiple investigators whom may use physical
or psychological and emotional violence while investigating the case.
During the three days trainings, multiple subjects were discussed
through different sessions focused on the law and legislation of Iraq,
KRI, international conventions, and also the psychological aspects.

In the first day of training, first session was dedicated for a review
on the juvenile welfare care where Mr. Bahzad explained for participants
the law, the application of law, and what are the gaps in this law.

The second session was delivered by Mr. Zeravan who focused on
techniques of investigation and what are the common errors conducted by
the officers during investigation.

Participants were engaged in a role play where they played the role of
child and investigator to realize the violations of human rights that
they practice unconsciously while investigating the case with children.
During the discussions participant said that "the nature of their work
and recurrent working in such cases is not making it easy for them to
stay in a calm manner while talking to the children". Part of
participants believed that they need to have a serious face so the child
may be afraid and admit the crime.

The second day of training was about the psychological causes for child
violent behaviors. Participants were taught on how to communicate with
each child and try to analyses the psychological and social impacts on
their behaviors. Participant practiced communication with children in
different scenarios gave by the facilitator.

In the third day of training, facilitator focused on self-care of police
officers especially when working for long times in crime cases.
Participants shared the challenges they face daily and how the working
environment is also affecting their personal life. Deep breathing and
relaxation techniques were also part of the third day exercises which
was given to the police officers.

Police officers are in need for routine psychological trainings as they
face challenging situations in their daily work, yet the job environment
put a huge barrier in front of them to ask for psychological help. Even
they were trained on how to investigate with children without using
violence, yet almost all participants believes that using little
threatening is not abusive behavior and it's legally accepted. They had
different definition for violence, according to participant using little
violence will encourage the child to admit what they did, and abuse and
violence were defined as using massive amount of violence against the
children.

In the end of the training certificate of participation were distributed
to all participants.
