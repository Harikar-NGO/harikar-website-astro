On the 22nd of October 2023, Harikar NGO, represented by our legal
coordinator, participated in the crucial general meeting of the
Coalition for Joint Responsibility (C4JR). The main agenda of this
gathering was the election of a new board member, a pivotal moment
that would determine our organization's future engagement with C4JR.

Amidst the challenges posed by the unfamiliarity of being newcomers to
the C4JR community and the task of rallying votes for a relatively
unknown participant, we are thrilled to announce that Harikar NGO was
successful. Our organization has successfully secured a position on
the C4JR board with an impressive 15 votes in favor, surpassing the
initial nomination of 12 NGOs.

The journey to navigate the election process was not without its
hurdles, especially in garnering support for a candidate who was
unfamiliar to many within the C4JR circles. However, with invaluable
support and guidance from our dedicated team, we successfully overcame
these challenges. The collaboration and determination displayed by our
team truly exemplify the spirit of Harikar NGO.

Looking ahead, we are eager and optimistic about the opportunities
that lie before us. Securing a position on the C4JR board means that
Harikar NGO can actively contribute to the organization's projects and
initiatives. This accomplishment marks a significant milestone for our
organization, and we are confident that our involvement will lead to
positive outcomes for both Harikar and C4JR.

We anticipate sharing further updates and progress as we actively
engage with C4JR initiatives. The success in the board member election
not only reflects the dedication and hard work of the Harikar team but
also signifies a strengthened partnership with C4JR.
