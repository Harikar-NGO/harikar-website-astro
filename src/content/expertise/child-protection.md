Harikar has successfully implemented 5 Child Protection (CP) projects in Iraq since 2017, with a primary focus on aiding Syrian refugees, internally displaced person(IDPs), and vulnerable children and youth. These initiatives have been specifically designed to improve access to education, child protection services, livelihoods and structured unstructured psychosocial support for this demographic.

Harikar's CP projects encompass a wide range of activities, including providing psychosocial support and life skills training for children and youth, establishing mother toddler groups and early childhood care and development (ECCD) activities, supporting youth clubs, regular sessions focused on resilience activities for both children and parents, offering multipurpose cash assistance and cash for protection to children and their families, providing life skills and vocational training for youth, business grants, apprenticeship services, hosting home-based Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) awareness sessions for children and families, and delivering case management services for children and youth. Furthermore, support was extended to duty bearers and community structures, including child protection committees and child rights clubs, to ensure the protection of at-risk girls and boys. 

These projects have had a significant impact on the lives of children and youth in need, contributing to the creation of a safer and more nurturing environment.
