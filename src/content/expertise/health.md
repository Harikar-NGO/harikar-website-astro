Harikar has undertaken four Health projects since 2017, with a primary focus on vulnerable young people, women, and girls, as well as crisis-affected populations in general. These projects aimed to enhance access to reproductive health services, address gender-based violence, and strengthen early warning disease detection.

Harikar's Health projects included key activities such as coordinating with the Iraqi Ministry of Health to ensure integrated high-quality reproductive health services, establishing and reinforcing programs on reproductive health, social cohesion, and civic engagement for vulnerable young people, especially marginalized adolescent girls in humanitarian settings. They also conducted initiatives to prevent gender-based violence and provide information on related services, offering a range of reproductive health services, including antenatal and postnatal care, family planning, deliveries, gynecological services, and clinical management of rape. Moreover, Harikar NGO carried out COVID-19 awareness campaigns for pregnant and new mothers and other community members.

The impact of Harikar's Health projects has been significant, improving the lives and well-being of vulnerable women and girls.
