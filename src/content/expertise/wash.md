Harikar has successfully implemented six Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) projects since 2017, with a primary focus on internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, and host communities. These projects have been dedicated to enhancing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, promoting hygiene practices, and reinforcing water conservation efforts.

The WASH projects conducted by Harikar have included a range of activities, such as drilling boreholes and constructing water networks in host communities, supplying camps with medical resources and enhancing solid waste management, rehabilitating water and sanitation networks and boreholes in camps and urban areas, providing vocational training on WASH and care and maintenance of WASH facilities, distributing water filters and hygiene kits, conducting hygiene promotion campaigns, developing and implementing a multi-sectoral water conservation concept paper, and offering safe water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion in underserved informal settlements and critical shelters.

The impact of Harikar's WASH projects has been significant, benefiting IDPs, returnees, and host communities. These efforts have played a crucial role in creating a healthier and more sustainable future by delivering essential services and promoting WASH practices.
